###Ghost Booberry Theme

This is just a fresh Ghost install modified to use a static homepage and includes a blog route.  The blog is located at your-site.com/blog.  The theme is a slightly modified version of the casper default Ghost theme.  Inspired by the cereal ;-)

To install, simply
```bash
npm install --production
```

Ghost likes Node v0.12
